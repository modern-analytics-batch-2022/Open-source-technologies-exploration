## Reviews
- ##### Good reviews :

    at the beginning Apache Drill is rated 4.2 stars out of 5, on the other hand Among the positive comments:
    - The best feature of Apache Drill is that it is open source, which is a free and easy to install tool. You can query a large amount of data from any source by simply enabling plugins.
    - Easy to use, developer friendly, no schema, code reusability
     - An easy way to write sql on non-sql databases. Creating a view, index, etc.
     - It is a quick query tool for any platform, whether csv files, parquet files in hdfs. Simply activate the plugins.

- #####  Bad reviews :

   - In drill, we cannot create a database or table. We can simply see the basic results using select instructions.
   - it freezes by showing us petabytes or terabytes of data.
   - Cannot read XML, no support for hierarchical queries, not much aggregation function
   - Complicated configuration, not supported on Windows
